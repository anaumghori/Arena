# 3D Geometric Vision

This repository is a collection of implementations, experiments, and algorithms mainly focused on 3D and geometric computer vision, with occasional explorations of other fundamental computer vision techniques. Each project includes its own README file, which contains the notes, explanations, and math derivations I wrote while learning these topics. These started as personal study notes, but I’m sharing them here in case they’re helpful to anyone else.  

There may still be errors, oversimplifications, or alternative interpretations in the notes. If you spot any mistakes, please feel free to reach out and let me know.  

## Available Implementations

| Project | Detailed Notes | Description |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| [Camera Calibration](CameraCalibration) | Available | Implementation of complete camera calibration, including intrinsic parameters, extrinsic poses, and distortion coefficients. |
| [Panorama Stitching](PanoramaStitching) | Available | Creates wide-field panoramic images from sequences of overlapping photographs. |

## Work in Progress

The following projects are currently under development:

- [ ] 3D Segmentation, Tracking & Collision Risk Estimation
- [ ] Point Cloud Reconstruction from Stereo Images
- [ ] Perform 3D keypoint detection via triangulation
